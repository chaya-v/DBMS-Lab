SELECT DISTINCT PNo
FROM PROJECT

(SELECT P.PNo
FROM PROJECT P,DEPARTMENT D ,EMPLOYEE E
WHERE P.DNo=D.DNo AND D.MgrSSN=E.SSN AND E.Name='Scott')
UNION
(SELECT W.PNo
FROM WORKS_ON W, EMPLOYEE E
WHERE E.SSN=W.SSN AND E.Name='Scott'));


2.
Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘IoT’ project is given a 10 percent raise.

SELECT E.Name,1.1* E.Salary AS Increased_salary
FROM EMPLOYEE E, WORKS_ON W, PROJECT P
WHERE E.SSN=W.SSN AND W.PNo=P.PNo AND P.PName='IoT';


3.
Find the sum of the salaries of all employees of the ‘Accounts’ department,as well as the maximum salary, the minimum salary, and the average salary in this department.

SELECT SUM (E. Salary) AS TOTAL_SALARY,MAX(E. Salary) AS
MAX_SALARY,MIN(E. Salary) AS MIN_SALARY,AVG(E. Salary) AS
AVG_SALARY
FROM EMPLOYEE E, DEPARTMENT D
WHERE E. DNo= D. DNo AND D.DName='Accounts';


4.
Retrieve the name of each employee who works on all the projects controlled by department number 5 (use NOT EXISTS operator).

SELECT E.Name
FROM EMPLOYEE E
WHERE NOT EXISTS((SELECT PNo FROM PROJECT WHERE DNo='D5')
MINUS (SELECT W.PNo FROM WORKS_ON W WHERE E.SSN=W.SSN));


5.
For each department that has more than five employees, retrieve the department number and the number of its employees who are making more than Rs. 6,00,000.

SELECT D.DNo,COUNT(*)
FROM EMPLOYEE E, DEPARTMENT D
WHERE E.DNo= D.DNo AND E.Salary>600000
GROUP BY D.DNo
HAVING COUNT(*)>=5;
